By no means is this ever complete. If you see something that you think
I could do better, please feel free to drop me a line at the email 
address attached to the github you got this code from.

Code Manifest:

PYTHON:

primeprinter.py
primeprintertest.py
-----

I wrote this for an interview with a software company 
that I'm not naming. It's generic enough that I can show it here. 

It's mainly here for style purposes.

urlgather.py
urlgathertest.py
-----

This is a very, very primative web crawler.

sellmyart/*
This is a directory containing the beginnings of a Django
artwork ecommerce site. It's about time I put this in a
code repository; something could conceivably happen to my
USB keydrive any day now. Before now, I have worked on parts
of Django sites, but never tried to build one from scratch before,
including the CSS, etc.


XSLT:

plist_to_usefulness.xsl
----------------------
This is some simple XSLT I wrote to turn an album listing exported 
from iTunes into something moderately useful.
