I'm constantly dropping things in this repository. There's no 
way I can possibly keep a code manifest up to date.

If you have any suggestions or comments for me regarding any of 
this, please let me know using whatever means of communication 
Github provides you. Thanks in advance. 

Please also see the shiny-website repository.
